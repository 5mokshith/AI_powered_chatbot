# AI Powered Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide intelligent and context-aware responses to user inputs. The chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and interact with users effectively.

## Features

* **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizes advanced NLP models to comprehend user queries and provide relevant responses.
* **Context-Aware Conversations**: Maintains context during interactions to offer coherent and meaningful dialogues.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with a modular architecture to facilitate scalability and easy integration of additional features.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* **backend/**: Contains the server-side code responsible for processing user inputs and generating responses.
* **frontend/**: Includes the client-side code that manages the user interface and handles user interactions.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend**: Python, Flask/Django (specify the framework used), NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React/Vue/Angular (specify the framework used)
* **AI Models**: Pre-trained language models such as GPT-3, BERT (specify the models used)

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/5mokshith/AI_powered_chatbot.git
   cd AI_powered_chatbot
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   * Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   * Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'
     ```
   * Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   * Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     python app.py  # Replace 'app.py' with the main application file
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   * Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   * Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   * Start the frontend application:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

* Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port) to interact with the chatbot.
* Enter your queries in the chat interface, and the chatbot will respond accordingly.
